## 👋 Hi, I'm Mike

I'm a **Full-Stack Software Developer** working at **OptusApp**, an SaaS company where we develop and maintain a **native app for the social housing sector**.  
I work primarily with the **MERN stack** - React, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB - as well as **React Native** for mobile development.  
Our infrastructure is **hosted on Azure**, where I help maintain and deploy production environments.

I studied **Physics with Space Science** at the **University of Leicester**, where I discovered my passion for programming through the coding-oriented courses in my degree.  
During my studies, I worked with **R**, **Python**, and **C**, which eventually inspired me to pivot into **software development** full time where I now specialise in **JS/TS**.

## 🔍 What I’m Currently Interested In

I’m always looking to understand **how things work at a deeper level** - both in software and hardware.  
Right now, I’m especially interested in:

- Diving deeper into **React’s internals** - reconciliation, rendering, and performance optimization  
- Learning more about **how computers and operating systems work** at a low level  
- Exploring other JavaScript frontend frameworks and libraries like **Vue.js**, **Three.js**, and **Svelte**  
- Improving my **UI/UX design skills** and workflow using tools like **Figma**
